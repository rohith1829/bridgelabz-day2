## How to Run These Projects üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

To get started with any of these Java assignments, follow these steps:

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    Open your terminal or Git Bash and clone this repository to your local machine:
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/rohit1829/bridgelabz-day2.git](https://github.com/rohit1829/bridgelabz-day2.git)
    ```

2.  **Navigate to the Project Directory:**
    Change your current directory to the newly cloned project folder:
    ```bash
    cd bridgelabz-day2
    ```

3.  **Open in your IDE:**
    Import the project into your preferred Java Integrated Development Environment (IDE) (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse). The IDE should recognize the project structure and build paths.

4.  **Compile and Run:**
    * Navigate to `src/com/bridgelabz/` within your IDE.
    * Locate the `.java` file for the assignment you wish to execute. Most assignments will contain a `public static void main(String[] args)` method.
    * You can then compile and run them directly from within your IDE.

    Alternatively, using the **command line**:
    ```bash
    # Navigate to the 'src' directory first
    cd src

    # Example for EmailValidator.java
    javac com/bridgelabz/EmailValidator.java  # Compiles the Java source file
    java com/bridgelabz/EmailValidator        # Runs the compiled Java class
    ```
    *(Note: You'll need to be in the `src` directory to run Java classes with package declarations from the command line.)*
